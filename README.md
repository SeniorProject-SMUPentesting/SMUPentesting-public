# SMU Cyber Infrastructure Test
<br />
## Project Description
The main idea of our project is to conduct a network penetration test on Saint Martin's University network infrastructure. This process will identify possible vulnerabilities that may put the university at risk for a cyber-attack. The implementation of the test will be conducted in two different ways. Our method will involve the use of hardware tools and software to conduct network security. 

## Motivation
In light of the news within the last year regarding system hacks and ransomware, cybersecurity has become an increasingly important consideration for organizations of every size. This is especially true for educational institutes as they've become lucrative targets for bad actors. With a large number of staff, faculty, and students continuously going in and out of their physical facilities and digital systems, as well as accessing their systems both on and off-site, universities are more susceptible to attacks than the average organization. With this in mind, we propose that Saint Martin's University (SMU) allow us to conduct exhaustive testing of their systems' security capabilities.
